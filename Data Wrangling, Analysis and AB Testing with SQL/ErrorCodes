			PRACTICE EXERCISE- ERROR CODES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise-1:
Goal: Here we use users table to pull a list of user email addresses. Edit the query to pull email
addresses, but only for non-deleted users.

Ans:
SELECT email_address, deleted_at
FROM dsv1069.users
WHERE deleted_at is NULL

Exercise-2:
Goal: Use the items table to count the number of items for sale in each category

Ans:
SELECT COUNT(*), category
FROM dsv1069.items
GROUP BY category

Exercise-3:
-Goal: Select all of the columns from the result when you JOIN the users table to the orders
table

Ans:
SELECT *
FROM dsv1069.users JOIN dsv1069.orders
ON dsv1069.users.id = dsv1069.orders.user_id

Exercise-4:
Check out the query below. This is not the right way to count the number of viewed_item
events. Determine what is wrong and correct the error.
-----------------------------------------------------
SELECT
COUNT(event_id) AS events
FROM dsv1069.events
WHERE event_name = ‘view_item’
-----------------------------------------------------

Ans:
SELECT
COUNT(event_id) AS events
FROM dsv1069.events
WHERE event_name = 'view_item'

Exercise-5:
Compute the number of items in the items table which have been ordered. The query
below runs, but it isn’t right. Determine what is wrong and correct the error or start from scratch.
--------------------------------------------------------
SELECT
  COUNT(item_id) as item_count
FROM dsv1069.orders
INNER JOIN dsv1069.items 
ON orders.item_id = items.id
--------------------------------------------------------

Ans:
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT o.item_id) AS item_count
FROM dsv1069.orders o
INNER JOIN dsv1069.items i ON o.item_id = i.id
